# hoplite-go
Our demonstration is primarily through the tests we built for hoplite, including for the node (both ODS and object management) and the scheduler. These tests can be found in hoplite/hoplite-test. The tests cover all of Hoplite's functionality that we implemented, and give example workflows that we also used for benchmarking.
